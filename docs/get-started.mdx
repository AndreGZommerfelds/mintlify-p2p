Start integrating P2P.org's staking capabilities into your platform in minutes. This guide will help you set up your environment and make your first API call.

## Quick Setup

1. **Get API Access**

   To get started with our APIs, you'll need to obtain authentication credentials. Visit our [Authentication Guide](/docs/authentication) for detailed instructions.

2. **Choose Your Environment**

   Production API endpoint:

   ```
   https://api.p2p.org
   ```

   Test environment endpoint:

   ```
   https://api-test.p2p.org
   ```

3. **Make Your First API Call**

   Try creating your first stake transaction using the Unified API (no funds required):

   ```sh Bash
   curl --request POST \
        --url https://api-test.p2p.org/api/v1/unified/staking/stake \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --header 'authorization: Bearer 8aAEXXJsogPZzpAKk1uedM7TYxPvGrBi' \
        --header 'content-type: application/json' \
        --data '
   {
     "chain": "polkadot",
     "network": "westend",
     "stakerAddress": "5FU44bZkd8iza8Sw8xS9QeRamsj9MpcBiwvLBReVDLBmd25q",
     "amount": 1
   }
   '
   ```

   This will return an unsigned transaction that you can review without committing any funds.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Authentication Setup

* Follow our [Authentication Guide](/docs/authentication) to get your API token
* Use JWT authentication for all API calls
* Include token in Authorization header

### 2. Choose Your Product

* [**Unified API**](/docs/unified-api-overview): Start here for multi-chain integration
* [**Staking API**](/docs/staking-overview): Direct staking operations
* [**Restaking API**](/docs/restaking-overview): Enhanced yield opportunities
* [**DVT Staking API**](/docs/overview-dvt-solutions): Distributed validation
* [**Data API**](/docs/overview): Analytics and monitoring

### 3. Test Your Integration

* Use test networks for initial development
* Validate responses and error handling
* Monitor rate limits and usage

### 4. Go Live

* Switch to production endpoints
* Configure network-specific parameters
* Set up monitoring and alerts
