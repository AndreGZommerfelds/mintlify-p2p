Staking Platform APIs use bearer JSON Web Token (JWT). Each client is assigned a unique authentication token for secure access to the service.

Contact [andre.zommerfelds@p2p.org](mailto:andre.zommerfelds@p2p.org) with your request, and you'll receive your authentication token directly via email or direct message.

Specify the received authentication token when interacting with our APIs. Pass the token in the Authorization header in the following format:

```sh cURL
authorization: Bearer <token>
```
